# Technologies Used


## Machine Learning Model 
- Yu


## Database

![Spotify Artist and Song ERD](https://github.com/zanelouis/Final_Project/blob/Keshs_branch/Spotify_Data_ERD.png)

The snapshot above represents the entity relationship diagram (ERD) for the Spotify data analysis project, and includes three tables for - 
#### Artist Data
One artist can have many songs and many genres

#### Song Data
One song can have many artists and many genres

#### Genre Data
One genre can have many artists and many songs

We will be housing the data in a SQL database (Postgres) and we hope to integrate it with Tableau to display and visualize the data

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.


## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.


## Dashboard
